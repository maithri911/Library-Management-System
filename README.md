# Library-Management-System
This project is part of the "Software Project Planning and Management Using Jira, Confluence, and GitHub" assignment. The objective is to build a simple Library Management System and demonstrate the SDLC process including planning, issue tracking, effort estimation, documentation, and version control.


The Library Management System is a simple web-based application created as part of the Software Project Planning and Management course using Jira, Confluence, and GitHub. The project focuses on planning, documenting, tracking, and developing a basic system that manages books, members, and the issue/return process. It includes essential CRUD operations such as adding, viewing, updating, and deleting books and member records, along with issuing and returning books. The system is built using basic web technologies and supported by a MySQL database. The entire project lifecycle—from requirement gathering, effort estimation, design, development, and testing—was managed using Jira, while all documentation, including project details, meeting notes, and effort estimation, was maintained in Confluence. GitHub was used for version control, code management, and tracking commits corresponding to Jira tasks. This project is intended for educational purposes and demonstrates an industry-standard workflow for software project planning and execution.
